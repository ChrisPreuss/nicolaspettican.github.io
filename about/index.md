> Bellow is a summary of the last 5 years of my career; a more detailed, chronologically ordered and less graphical version of my CV.

I **highlighted the key words** in case you want to skim through!

<i class="fa fa-globe fa-lg"></i>
	
I come from a [small sea-side town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denia) on the East Coast of Spain. There I volunteered in different charity organisations such as [ADAHMA](https://www.facebook.com/ADAHMAtdah) and [C.A.B.](http://www.condenadosalbordillo.org/), and started to develop **entrepreneurial skills** by selling goods grown in my orchard. I did my **A-levels** in a Spanish college, so I had to be examined on **10** different **subjects**: Maths, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, English language, English grammar, Philosophy, Spanish literature, Catalan language, and History of Spain! (Yes, that many...). Having done the non-science subjects proved very useful in developing my **writing** and **communication skills**. After finishing college I pursued my interest in **biological sciences** and **business** and came to the **University of Manchester** in 2012.

<i class="fa fa-institution fa-lg"></i>

During my degree, **[BSc Biotechnology with Enterprise](http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/biotechnology/)**, I took modules in pharmacology, biotechnology, bioethics, neuroscience, clinical drug development and physiology as well as **market research**, **management**, **entrepreneurial skills** and other business studies. I learnt how to apply research tools and resources in order to **analyse markets** and assess the feasibility of business opportunities and products. I was taught to analyse data derived from experiments in the lab, biological databases, and from market research to generate knowledge and understanding. Some of the projects required us to develop innovative products, **develop marketing strategies** and use risk management tools to assess their feasibility. 

As part of my **extracurricular activities**, I was a committee member of the **[Faculty of Life Sciences’ Society](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/school-of-biological-sciences-society-sobss)** for which I was elected representative in the 1st year, **marketing** and events **manager** in 2nd year and **vice president** in my 3rd and final year. During this tenure I **used surveys** and focussed group research to understand members’ interests on events and activities. As a result of the findings I was able to market, promote and organise many successful events and **raise funds** for the society. During my time in **halls of residence** I was democratically elected **event manager**, where I provided a fun and enjoyable year for the residents.

I also participated in **solidarity** and cultural **events** through other societies such as [NHSF](http://manchester.nhsf.org.uk/), practiced **sports** such as athletics and weightlifting and was even **mentored** by life coaches, which increased my **self-motivation** and interpersonal skills. 

<i class="fa fa-money fa-lg"></i>

To **fund my studies** I had to **work part-time** throughout my degree in **public relations**, **event management** and even **sales management** in different local events companies. Throughout my degree I did everything from street promotion, networking to ticket sales management and **marketing**. I gained a good sense of commercial awareness and acquired skills in **communication**, **sales**, **marketing** and **management**.

<i class="fa fa-leaf fa-lg"></i>

In the **summer** before my final year I undertook a **research project** at the **University of Sheffield** with Dr Hughes, completely [funded](http://www.bspp.org.uk/funds/vacation.php) by the **British Society of Plant Pathology**. I studied the differences in the wheat metabolome during fungal infection (eyespot). It was a great experience, one where I undertook my own work while also assisting Dr Hughes with his research.

<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-lg"></i>

During my **final year** I undertook a project set by the **Manchester Business School**, where I had to **develop** and **market** a **product** from start to finish while delivering a **pitch** in order to **obtain funding**. I developed and used **online surveys** to **gather information** from over 400 people and conducting **desk research** (Mintel reports) to **assess the feasibility**. My **final year project** (dissertation), adjacent to the former, involved the use of **computational resources** in order to study the variability of a particular class of P450 enzymes: P450-BM3. This led me to be interested in IT and programming, which led me to undertake a Master's in Computational Biology. I also attended business workshops such as the **XING business game**, aimed at designing and presenting a business plan together with the team, for which I got awarded **best presenter**. I volunteered for different events organised by bodies in the University of Manchester such as [Outreach Events](http://www.engagement.manchester.ac.uk/resources/links/) for **science communication** and [Multilingual Manchester](http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/). 

I **graduated** with a **2.1 with honours** in the summer of 2015.

<i class="fa fa-money fa-lg"></i>

Before starting my **Master’s** I worked in catering at [Warner Brother’s Studio London](https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/) to **fund** it. Despite not being part of my field of study or expertise, this job proved to be a **challenge** that I managed to **surpass**. The constant pressure of serving on average 5000 customers a day **improved my endurance** and the reward scheme for attaining the **highest sales** pushed me to eventually achieve the highest number of average “spend per head” in my department! During my spare time I took online programming course and optimised my IT skills.

<i class="fa fa-laptop fa-lg"></i>

At the **present** time I am completing a **[Master’s in Computational Biology (Bioinformatics)](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/08854/bioinformatics-and-systems-biology-msc/)**, considered one of the [fastest growing field of biology](http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/2/69.full) which may have the biggest impact on the health industry in the near future. Despite the **steep learning curve** I have **greatly enhanced** my **computational skills**. I have learned to program in different languages such as **Python** (2.7), **Perl**, **R** and **Java** and during my **spare time** I take online courses to **learn more** about [Python](https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-python-programming-course/) and **[web design](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/)** with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. I have also acquired skills in **data analysis**, from how and what type **statistical analysis** to use, to using **tools** such as **R** and, of course, **Excel**. As another highlight I **co-founded** the **[Bioinformatics Society](http://uombio.info/)**, which delivers workshops and talks about techniques and **resources** that can aid researchers and students when **analysing their data**. I am also currently working for the University as a **Student Ambassador**, professionally representing the University when providing tours, information and answering queries through emails and telephone calls to prospective undergraduate and postgraduate students.

<i class="fa fa-sun-o fa-lg"></i>

I am quite **proactive**, so when I'm not in the University working on my project I am **creating vector illustrations** for my future **animations** (e.g. for **science communication**), learning something new about **Python** or **JavaScript**, exercising outside or in the gym, writing content for my future **[blog](http://www.pettiblog.com)**, or practicing **web design** by working on my websites such as this one, which received a makeover recently!
